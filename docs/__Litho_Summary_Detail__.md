    "detailed_description": "main.rs is the execution entry point for the Litho Book project. It initializes the application environment, parses command-line arguments, builds the document tree, starts the web server, and handles system-level operations. It coordinates the workflows of multiple modules (cli, error, filesystem, server), completing the full lifecycle from user input to service startup. The core workflow includes parsing command-line arguments, initializing logging, printing the startup banner, validating arguments, scanning the documentation directory to build the file tree, creating the Axum router, binding the TCP listener port, starting the HTTP service, and automatically opening the browser when needed. This component is the startup hub for the whole application; it does not implement business logic, but delegates tasks to other modules as a coordinator.",

Its core function is to recursively scan a specified directory, convert the filesystem structure into an in-memory tree data structure (DocumentTree), and support full-text search, Markdown rendering, and file content reading. It abstracts files and directories in the filesystem as FileNode nodes, and uses DocumentTree to uniformly manage file path mappings, search indexes, and statistics. This component is specifically optimized for Markdown files: it indexes only .md files, ignores hidden files, and traverses dot directories. It also implements keyword-based full-text search, including title weighting, term-frequency weighting, context extraction, and result sorting, ultimately returning search results with highlighting and relevance scores. In addition, it provides Markdown-to-HTML rendering for frontend display.",

It integrates standard-library IO errors and serde_json serialization errors, and defines application-specific errors such as file not found, invalid path, directory scan failure, server error, and configuration error. By implementing From<LithoBookError> for axum::http::StatusCode, it automatically maps application-layer errors to HTTP status codes, providing a standardized error response mechanism for the Axum HTTP framework. It is the core hub of system error handling.",

It provides four main capabilities: document browsing, full-text search, system statistics, and AI assistant streaming conversations. It defines route handlers that process frontend requests, including retrieving file content (rendering Markdown as HTML), retrieving the directory tree, executing full-text search, returning system statistics, health checks, and AI chat streaming responses. The AI chat function calls the GitHub Models OpenAI-compatible API, builds requests containing the system prompt, context, and history messages, and uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to return AI responses to the frontend chunk by chunk. This component also generates the homepage HTML template and is the main boundary layer for user-system interaction.",

It parses configuration such as the documentation directory path, service port, host address, whether to automatically open the browser, and whether to enable verbose logging. The validate method validates input arguments, ensuring the documentation directory exists and is a directory, and checks whether administrator privileges are available for privileged ports (<1024). It also provides the helper methods server_url and bind_address for generating service address strings. The component includes the platform-specific is_privileged function to detect whether the current process has administrator privileges and support cross-platform port-permission checks.",
